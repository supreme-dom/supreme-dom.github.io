                <h2>My Goals</h2>
                <p>I hope to be in the MLB as a starting pitcher for the Dodgers but if that goes south, getting a good degree in technology would be great aswell.

Career Interests: I would like to be in the MLB as a pitcher one day but if not I would enjoy a technology related job.</p>
