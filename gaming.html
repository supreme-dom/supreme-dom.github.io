                <h2>My Experience</h2>
                <p>Ever since I was little I always took interest in video games. With two older brotheres I would always play with them and I would play often. I have been playing all types of games like sports and computer games. When I was growing up I spent a lot of time in my room playing because I had finished my homework and now I often find myself playing 2k18 a lot of the time after doing my homework. Gaming has always had a major impaact on my life and still does. Sometimes in class I even go off and play some games but still pay attention.</p>
